\subsection{Detailed Description}
scene is a class for collecting each integration step during an exposure. 

These will then be summed to make frames, which are the physically relevant unit of an image. frames are then summed to create the full images.

User Variables\+: None. All variables in the image object are added dynamically

Computed Variables\+: star\+I\+Ds\+: Similar to the star\+ID varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. RA\+: Similar to the RA varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. DE\+: Similar to the DE varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. n1\+: Similar to the n1 varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. n2\+: Similar to the n2 varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. n3\+: Similar to the n3 varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. VT\+: Similar to the VT varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. B\+VT\+: Similar to the B\+VT varable that is held in the camera object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. c1\+: Similar to the c1 varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. c2\+: Similar to the c2 varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. c3\+: Similar to the c3 varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. I\+: Similar to the I varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. pixel\+: Similar to the pixel varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. line\+: Similar to the line varable that is held in the image object, but with only stars/facets that are in the F\+OC of this scene. detector\+Array\+: array of summed intensities on each pixel during the integration timestep of this scene. Does not include noise. Added by \hyperlink{classcamera_1_1image_ad5fcc766f1a0be37d8437f46d0fe720d}{image.\+update\+State()}
