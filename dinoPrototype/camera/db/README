Currently the DINO C-REx stellar database (tycho.db) is larger than
GitHub's file size limit (~300MB > 100MB). This document describes the
official method for getting the most up to date version. It includes
downloading a base version of the db from the DINO C-REx google drive
and using version-controlled scripts to edit it into the most recent
version.

1. Download the base version from the drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B0y3sDp6O1i8OXd4X0Rxcy1pQm8

2. Put it in {your_DINO_repo}/dinoPrototype/camera/db

3. In {your_DINO_repo}/dinoPrototype/camera/db, run the script
update_db.py
